<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>I changed the logic of how the ball moves when hitting a paddle<br>to more accurately line up with the original pong rules. Removed the "spin"<br>mechanic and changed the ball's y velocity based on where it hits the<br>paddle. For example, if the ball hit the center of the paddle, it<br>would go straight forward every time. If it hits slightly off center, for<br>example lower than the center of the paddle, it will also move downwards.</div><div><br></div><div>Also<br>fixed a small bug where if the ball hit the top/bottom of a<br>paddle it would trigger the bounceBall() function multiple times and get stuck inside<br>it, accumulating speed.</div><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Caption:</em> <p>Yeah, it&#39;s kinda hard to see this one in a static image. The<br>ball hit the center of the left paddle, so it went straight. If<br>it was off center, it would&#39;ve had additional y velocity.<br></p>

<tr><td> <em>Caption:</em> <p>Now pass in a parameter to determine which paddle specifically (left or right)<br>the ball is hitting, rather than just flipping the direction. Also added two<br>new variables, ballCenter and paddleCenter. As you might expect, these keep track of<br>the ball and paddle centers respectively. The paddleCenter is based on the side<br>that was passed into the function, so it picks the right paddle to<br>get coords from. The variable diff at the bottom calculates the relative difference<br>between the y position of the ball and paddle it hit. Using that<br>value, the direction (up/down) and strength of the ball&#39;s y velocity is determined.<br>I chose to divide the diff value by 8 simply because it felt<br>right after testing it out a few times.<br></p>

<tr><td> <em>Caption:</em> <p>Just added a variable to track which paddle was last hit in order<br>to prevent the same paddle triggering the bounceBall() function multiple times.<br></p>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Added a powerup to the game that spawns at random times somewhere in<br>the center of the board. If a player hits the ball into the<br>powerup, the size of their paddle increases slightly.<br><br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Caption:</em> <p>If the powerup isn&#39;t spawned, check a random number to see if it<br>should be spawned that frame. If so, create the powerup object. If it&#39;s<br>already spawned, ignore checking random numbers and instead draw the object onto the<br>canvas. Then check if the ball is touching the object. If it is,<br>use a bit of logic to determine which player gets the bonus (check<br>the x velocity of the ball to determine which player &quot;owns&quot; it). The<br>player that last touched the ball gets a small boost.<br></p>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Talk about what you learned during this assignment and the related HTML5 Canvas readings (at least a few sentences for full credit)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Learned about how canvas works in general. The canvas is a coordinate grid<br>starting at(0, 0) from the top left and ending (?, ?) at the<br>bottom right. Larger x values mean more towards the right, and smaller x<br>values mean more towards the left. Larger y values mean more towards the<br>bottom, and smaller y values mean more towards the top. (why couldn&#39;t it<br>just be like a normal coordinate grid) Canvas objects first have to be<br>created and assigned to a variable using the fillRect() or drawRect() functions. After<br>they are created, they then have to be drawn onto the canvas using<br>variable.draw(). It doesn&#39;t automatically draw the object when it&#39;s created. Also, anything drawn<br>is put on the top layer, so it&#39;ll overwrite anything that was previously<br>in its location. The canvas acts pretty much like an actual piece of<br>paper, where previous drawings are left on, and new drawings overwrite them. Using<br>the erase() function clears the canvas, getting rid of all the old drawings.<br><br></p><br></td></tr>
